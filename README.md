## Platform Description

The goal of this project is to create an open source CoAP Platform to be used as a part of an IoT system, based on CoAP technology.

The platform consists in several sub-application described below:

* **Py-HTTP-CoAP**: An HTTP REST API which maps an HTTP PUT request (with JSON body) into desired CoAP request.  
* **HTTP Client**: An HTTP Client interface to interact with HTTP Sever Py-HTTP-CoAP. There, the user can configure arguments for CoAP request like CoAp server, Port, Method, Payload, etc.
* **Embedded CoAP Server**: A git submodule of embedded CoAP server which can runs in different platforms like ESP32 or ESP8266 based in Arduino framework. More info in its README file.

All of this parts are well described in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/agustinBassi/coap-connection/wiki). Please, refer to it in order to get all required information.

In the figure below there is a description of the platform modules and how they interact each others.

## 
## Install dependencies


The application runs over Raspberry Pi 3+ (or Linux system based in Debian). To install Raspberry Pi OS refer to [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

The platform needs the next dependencies.

* Python 3.x (installation steps in [official documentation](https://python.org)).
* Docker (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
* Docker-Compose (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).


## 
## Run the application

Once dependencies are installed in the Raspberry Pi do the next steps.

1. Download the platform code (this repository) with the next command.

```
git clone https://github.com/agustinBassi/coap-connection.git
cd coap-connection/
```

2. Compile the Py-HTTP-CoAP docker image with the command below.

```
docker-compose build http-to-coap-server
```

3. Start the Py HTTP CoAP converter and the HTTP Client with the next command.

```
docker-compose up
```

4. Run the HTTP Client opening [http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/](http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/) in the web browser.
