## Platform Description

The goal of this project is to create an open source CoAP Platform to be used as a part of an IoT system, based on CoAP technology.

The platform consists in several sub-application described below:

* **HTTP-CoAP Interface**: An HTTP REST API which maps an HTTP PUT requests (with JSON body containing CoAP fields request) into desired CoAP request. It is an 'Interface' because it does not map a HTTP request method into CoAP request method, nor does not map CoAP status code into HTTP status code. Instead, it acts as an interface where a user can execute CoAP requests from web a client and can see the CoAP response as well.
* **HTTP-CoAP Web Client**: A Single Page Application (SPA) HTTP Client interface to interact with `HTTP-CoAP Interface` API. There, the user can configure arguments for CoAP request like CoAp server, Port, Method, Payload, etc.
* **Embedded CoAP Server**: A git submodule of embedded CoAP server which can runs in different platforms like ESP32 or ESP8266 based in Arduino framework. More info in its [README file](https://github.com/agustinBassi/embedded-coap-server).

All of this parts are well described in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/agustinBassi/coap-connection/wiki). Please, refer to it in order to get all required information.

In the figure below there is a description of the platform modules and how they interact each others.

## 
## Install dependencies


The application runs over Raspberry Pi 3+ (or any system with Python & Docker Compose). To install Raspberry Pi OS refer to [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

The platform needs the next dependencies.

* Python 3.x (installation steps in [official documentation](https://python.org)).
* Docker (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).
* Docker-Compose (installation steps in [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).

## 
## Run the application

Once dependencies are installed in the system, do the next steps.

1. Download the platform code (this repository) with the next command.

```
git clone https://github.com/agustinBassi/coap-connection.git
cd coap-connection/
```

2. Compile the `HTTP-CoAP Interface` docker image with the command below. 

```
docker-compose build http-coap-interface
```

> **_NOTE:_**: The default architecture to compile is for ARM. If it is needed to compile for x86-64 just comment/uncomment the lines 8-9 in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Start the `HTTP-CoAP Interface` and the `HTTP-CoAP Web Client` with the next command.

```
docker-compose up
```

4. Run the `HTTP-CoAP Web Client` opening [http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/](http://raspberri_pi_ip:5001/) in the web browser.


## 
## Test the application

Once the containers are running and the `HTTP-CoAP Web Client` opened in the browser, its time to test if communication between web client and `HTTP-CoAP Interface` works ok. To avoid to get a CoAP server running in this step, the best way to test is calling and endpoint that will echo the CoAP request settings into the `Response Logs` section. The default fields values will call to the test endpoint without fill any field in the web client interface. So, just press `Request` button in the interface, and the echo with default values will be shown in the `Response Logs` section. 

In the screenshot below there is an example with all possible CoAP fields set, in order to show them in the logs.

If a real CoAP request to a real CoAP server is needed, just put in the `HTTP TO COAP ENDPOINT URL` the value [http://localhost:5100/api/v1/http_to_coap/](http://localhost:5100/api/v1/http_to_coap/). If the application is running in a remote host, like a Raspberry Pi, change `localhost` to the remote host IP address in the URL field.
